```
### Translation Animation
```java
TranslationAnimation tanslationAnimation =
                        new TranslationAnimation.TranslationAnimationBuilder(view,
                                               TranslationAnimation.TranslationMode.TranslationAll, startY, endY)
                                               .arcMode(TranslationAnimation.ArcMode.ArcUpward)
                                               .additionStartPoint(startX)
                                               .additionEndPoint(endX)
                                               .build();
tanslationAnimation.show();
```
### Blur Animation
```java
BlurAnimation blurAnimation =
                        new BlurAnimation.BlurAnimationBuilder(bitmapScale, blurRadius)
                        .build();
